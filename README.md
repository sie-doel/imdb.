# IMDb Top 1000 Movies â€“ Data Outputs

This repository contains cleaned datasets and summarized outputs derived from an analysis of the IMDb Top 1000 movies dataset using R. The project focuses on uncovering insights related to genre popularity, movie ratings, and box office performance.

##  Project Overview

The original dataset was cleaned and transformed in R using tidyverse tools. The cleaning process involved:
- Converting columns to appropriate data types (e.g., Runtime, Gross, IMDB_Rating)
- Removing missing or malformed data
- Parsing and formatting numerical fields

These cleaned and derived datasets were then exported for visualization and further use in portfolio web development.
